> **Processes** :
 
>■	After we briefly described the design, we asked the user to verbalize her feelings and thoughts about the website and the task she would do. She liked the design in general. She quickly found the menu, tapped on the different available buttons, and went to the status page. From there, she accomplished finding her status.

>■	There were at least three issues during the test. First, when she found the home button at the foot bar, she tapped on it but received no response. She repeated it on several pages. Second, she could not press the submit button, which made her confused. She could not progress and implicitly asked for help. Third, she tapped on “status page” (hyperlink), and since we did not consider a function for it, she was puzzled, unsure about the next step. Moreover, the computer’s mouse pad was not friendly, which caused discomfort for her during the test. The last point is that the user felt tired and not in the mood to challenge the design.

> After analyzing the feedbacks we realized that the design suffers aligment issue. Several elemetns were misaligned. We revisited all elements and aligned objects, buttons, and texts.
 
>![Yes No not aligned](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46515738/142395230-726f2de2-71ac-4541-b763-1c3600e17ddf.jpg)

> The search bar had a low contrast. In the second version we thought of a blue search bar which did not pass the user test. We came up with another search bar which was accepted by users.

 >Regarding the text, we increased the size of text and the margin in the first and second page, added height to texts on How Do I and For Travelers pages. Moreover, from the impression test, we came up with a solution for the empty space in the first page by distributing the elements in the page.

> The animation speed was decreased to give a real-time page load impressio to the users.

> After resolving the interactive button/tap issue, we added home button function based on the recent user test. We also added scrol down animation to the status bar hyperlink
