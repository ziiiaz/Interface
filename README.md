# UX Interface Design | Department of Homeland Security Website
> DH110 | Zia Khoshsirat


> ## **Summary** : 
After accomplishing the low-fidelity or prototype version of the website, in this project, we test certain functions/tasks in an interface that represents the actual website. 
> ## **The first interface**: [LIGHT MODE](https://www.figma.com/file/EJZ52gsjHjgZnSMh4kaA5j/DH110-Interface-Design-Copy)

> ## **Processes**:
> 
> ### **Grid Layout** : 
> The first step was to understand the size of the screen and accordingly divide it between the elements we wanted to use on each page. We used three different layers of the grid to distribute elements evenly horizontally and vertically. 

>![grid 2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46515738/140888474-5d34491e-9dee-4f69-ae5a-323866f7db7c.jpg)

>The alignment of elements was based on the Gestalt principles: similarity, continuation, and proximity.

> ### **Typography**: 
> The primary font is ‘Yrsa’ to assure the readability and legibility of contents. Due to its clean and crispy edges, it is easier for the eyes to follow the words on small screens like cell phones. However, as the user mentioned, when the font size goes under 8 pt, then it is not easy to read the text without scaling the screen up. 

![FONT 4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46515738/140889512-d1b67a9b-6426-4e5f-b2f2-5bf05c156484.jpg)

>In order to comply with the proper usage of the Gestalt principle, the space between the lines is modified to 18 versus the default 22 pt space.

> ### **Shapes** : 
> Three social media logos, Facebook, Twitter, and also email logos, are changed to sharper, brighter ones with added shades. In the previous version, these logos were blurred.

> The search icon with the letter ‘search’ is replaced with a search button on the top right corner of the screen.

>The previous design did not consider a way to separate the last revision of the website, the main contents, and the bottom of the page. To avoid confusion, we followed the Gestalt’s proximity principle, in this design, two lines are added to separate the latest revision of the webpage and the other contents.

We tried to keep the flow of the elements smooth by decreasing the pictures’ corners less sharp.

> ### **color**: 
> After analyzing the primary logo’s colors, we tried to apply them to all the pages. We changed the background color FFFF in the light mode to FCFCFC. We also modified text colors other than 0000 to ones with a higher rate of contrast.

> We tried to keep the screen’s brightness low as we did not sacrifice the contrast in the dark mode. One of the issues we encountered was non-textual elements which are almost impossible to modify their color. Although we could change the contents’ color to darker ones, the elements like logos and buttons are left intact. For example, the + and  – signs, as well as menu buttons, are hardly visible. 

>All the contrast ratios were passed for AA and almost all them passed for AAA:

> ### **User Test** : [HERE](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DoKFn3_Z7xZOAI2ju7byfC8q-de1N2CG/view?usp=sharing)
> The test was performed on Figma’s flow present. After adding over 70 flows, we asked a user to see if the purpose of the project was achievable at the end. We told her based on which persona we designed and/or revised the website. 


> The user smoothly passed one step after another until she reached the end of the project. She successfully finished the task; however, she could not go back. Not all flows were considered and/or working. She noticed that the website had another way to go back to the previous page, but we had not placed flow. In the revision, we added over 20 more flows to fix the issue.

> After finishing the light mode, we asked the user to test the color and contrast of the dark mode. She did not prefer colors like green and purple . We later tested the 
contrast ratio—which they failed in the test—and changed them to AA-passed colors. Since the text in the box does not contain important information we did not change the contrast of the text in the box to pass the contrast ratio test.

## Reflection: 
> This project aimed to enhance the interface design with a focus on accessibility/contrast, smoother design, and affordance of elements in the design. Based on the scenario that we followed during the past two phases, we re-designed the tracking page so that a possible user spends less time to accomplish the task. As all parts of a design leave their trace and effect on the entirety of the system, we believe that the offered changes result in the user’s interaction with the system. Unlike the light mode, which apparently passed most tests, the dark mode has a long way to be completed.
